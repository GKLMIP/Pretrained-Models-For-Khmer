# Pretrained-Models-For-Khmer


## Introduction
In this work, we present transformer-based PTMs for the Khmer language for the first time. We evaluate our models on two downstream tasks: part-of-speech tagging and news categorization; the dataset for the latter task is self-constructed. In addition, we find that the current Khmer word segmentation technology does not aid performance improvement. For more details of our dataset or our models, please see our paper “Pre-trained Models and Evaluation Data for the Khmer Language”.
